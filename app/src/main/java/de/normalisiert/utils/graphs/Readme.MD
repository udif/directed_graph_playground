DG Playground
=============

This is a small app I wrote to play around with some directed graph algorithms.
Source code is in:  
https://github.com/udif/directed_graph_playground


The implementation of D.B Johnson's cycles algorithm was taken from:
https://github.com/josch/cycles_johnson_meyer
and forked by myself under:
https://github.com/udif/cycles_johnson_meyer/tree/dev

The main table can be created by adding rows using the ADD button.
When you add a row, please fill it with the source and destination nodes.
Thge sort button will sort the table.
The RANDOMIZE button will create a random graph on the existing table rows, with the number of nodes being approximately half the number of rows.

Pressing RUN will run the D.B. Johnson algorithm for Finding all the elementary circuits of a directed graph.
For more detailson this algorithm, please consult the repositories above,
