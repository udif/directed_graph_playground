        This program processes a list of vertexes given in the form of a source and destination node numbers,
        starting at 0, describing a directed graph.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        The output is a list of all elementary circuits of the graph given.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;The algorithm is based on:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        Johnson, D.B. (1975) &lt;i&gt;Finding All the Elementary Circuits of a Directed Graph.&lt;/i&gt; SIAM Journal on Computing, 4, 77-84.&lt;br/&gt;
