        This program processes a list of vertexes given in the form of a source and destination node numbers,
        starting at 0, describing a directed graph.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        The output is a list of all elementary circuits of the graph given.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;The algorithm is based on:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

        How to use this program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        This is a small app I wrote to play around with some directed graph algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        The main table can be created by adding rows using the ADD button.&lt;br/&gt;
        When you add a row, please fill it with the source and destination nodes.&lt;br/&gt;
        The sort button will sort the table.&lt;br/&gt;
        The RANDOMIZE button will create a random graph on the existing table rows, with the number of nodes being approximately half the number of rows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        Pressing RUN will run the D.B. Johnson algorithm for Finding all the elementary circuits of a directed graph.&lt;br/&gt;
        For more details on this algorithm, please consult the repositories as appearing in the About window&lt;br/&gt;

        Why don\'t you add some rows first?&lt;br/&gt;
        Let me suggest at least 4.&lt;br/&gt;
        If you don\'t know how to fill the rows, just press the RANDOMIZE button.
